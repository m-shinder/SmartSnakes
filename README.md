# Smart Snakes
This project made as university course exam
And so will be barely updated.

Project is about weak AI playing snake

## Containment
`snake.py` file contains game that can be played separately
`neural.py` file contains bunch of ways to make neurlal network learn
`.pres/` folder contains slides and files used during presenation:
. `snake.py` -- same as parent folder
. `hbfs.py` -- naive way where every snake has own food
. `adam.py` -- handmade snake with preadjusted network
. `sisyphus.py -- adam, but food is in same place for everyone`
. `prometheus.py` -- sisyphus, but snakes now learns
. `smartSnakes.odp` -- slides

## Conclusion
Project is in unfinished state. success of snakes is unsatisfiable for me
I have some ideas to improve it, but i have no time.
Maybe I'll use this repo to bump my GH activity :D

## Contribution
Any contributions are welcome!
Especially if they will improve snake's score

## Known issues
. Selfmade math performance is awful
. Fitness function based only on snake's lifetime is awful
. Having single food on map is awful idea
